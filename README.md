This is a studie project made to develop ReactJS and learn it's concepts.

In this project I've build a ReactJS financial control app following the best praticts for react and css. Also learned about styled-components, hooks, useContext, useEffect, useState.

The whole project keeps in mind accessibility too, you can navigato through the app with the keyboard with no problem at all.

For UI/UX design we use Figma with the design build to guide.
